Notes: - I had a problem on the printing again
       - I fixed it by adding a .close() for the FileWriter.
       - There is a small problem on the printing I should go home and edit
       - The program started to close on me
       - I realized as I was adding option I did not change the condition
         for the while loop.
       - A little more design would be nice for the text files
